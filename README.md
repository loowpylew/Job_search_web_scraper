# Job_search_web_scraper

This program has been created to automate the process of searching for jobs related to software engineering within the given local area. In my case, it is 'Hatfield'. 
Thus all jobs displayed on the terminal will either be in hatfield(town) or within Hertfordshire(county). 

The output as a result of running the program will be: 
- The title of the job
- The name of the company 
- Their star rating as an employer (if provided)
- The annual salary (if provided) 
- And a description which may include details such as: 
  - Job requirements
  - Technologies that will be used as part of the job etc... 
  
  Further developments are to: 
  - Include an input area where users can type in the name and location rather than having to go onto the website to specify and then 
    copy and paste the link within the code. 
  - Link under each job which will direct user to apply now page.
